# Number Guessing Game in Python

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This is a fun and simple Python game where you guess a randomly selected number by the computer. The game gives you feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct. It’s a great way to practice Python and game logic in a friendly, interactive way.

## Features:

* The computer generates a random number between **1** and **100**.
* After each guess, you’ll receive feedback whether your guess is **too low**, **too high**, or **correct**.
* The game continues until you guess the correct number.
* (Optional) Add a challenge by limiting the number of guesses.

## Why This Project?

This game is a perfect way to learn and practice:

* **Random number generation** in Python.
* **While loops** for continuous user interaction.
* **Input validation** to ensure the user enters valid guesses.
* **Conditional feedback** to guide the player and keep the game fun.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

* Python 3.x (any version should work)

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaushik4636/Number-guessing-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Number-guessing-game
   ```

3. **Run the game**:

   ```bash
   python number_guessing_game.py
   ```

   After running the script, you'll be prompted to guess a number. The game will give you feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low, and will continue until you guess the correct number.

## How to Play:

1. **The computer picks a random number** between 1 and 100.
2. **Guess the number** by typing it into the terminal.
3. After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess is:

   * **Too low!**
   * **Too high!**
   * **Correct!**
4. Once you guess the right number, the game will congratulate you and tell you how many attempts it took.

### Example Interaction:

```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Make a guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Make a guess: 30
Too low! Try again.
Make a guess: 40
Congratulations! You've guessed the number in 3 attempts.
```
